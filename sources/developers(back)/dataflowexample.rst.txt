======================================
Example: Work/Data Flow (TOADD)
======================================

We will show the simplest case of a Cymphony workflow. A requester defines a workfow with only one job node. In the job node, the requestor only invites one worker to annoate one tuple as true or false. 

We will print the sequence of all functions invoked, as well as the input/output of each function. The main purpose is to clearly show that how Cymphony works using a running example.
